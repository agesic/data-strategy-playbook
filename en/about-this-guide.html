                  <p>Countries with more sophisticated data infrastructure have been adopting an increasingly holistic approach to data management, which facilitates coordination and promotes innovation while safeguarding privacy and individual rights. Recognizing the diversity of the region and the different levels of progress among governments regarding data initiatives, this tool represents an opportunity for countries to conduct a self-assessment, that will determine the maturity level of strategic elements in their data management. As a result, administrations will be able to identify areas for improvement and establish priorities, enabling them to develop a national (or local) data strategy.</p>
